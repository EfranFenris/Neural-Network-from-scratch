	•	8 Bag: Very compact and clearly separated in the regularized model; less mixing with shoes.
	•	1 Trouser: More compact and coherent; still near Dress (3) because of similar elongated silhouettes.
	•	5/7/9 Footwear: Regularization tightens the shoe manifold; we still see partial overlap (open vs closed, ankle height), which is expected.
	•	0/2/4/6 Tops: Closest neighbors and partly blended in both versions; differences are subtle.
